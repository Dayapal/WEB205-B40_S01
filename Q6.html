    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and bhavior of matter. It is
        fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. <b>E</b>ach elements is represented by its
        chemical symbol, such as <b>F</b>e for iron. H for hydrogen. and <b>O</b> for oxygen. Elements are classified
        into groups and periods based on their properties. </p>

    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>

    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. <b>H</b>ere's example of a <i>chemical reactions</i>
    </p>

    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O <sub>2</sub> â†’ 2H <sub>2</sub>O</p>

    <p>This equations represents the reactions between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxgen (O<sub>2</sub>) to form
        water (H <sub>2</sub>O)</p>
        <h4>Imprtant Concepts</h4>
        <p>stoichometry is the calculations of reactants and products reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are consrved.</p>

        <p><sub>Subscripts</sub>indicate the number of atoms of each elements in a molecule, while<sup>superscritps</sup> represents charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

 <h2>Conclusion</h2>

 <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies. chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
